Week two for the final projects. I made some progress last week, but not as much as I would have liked.

Today I continued trying to optimize my custom grid search to find the optimal number of n_components for my NMF model.

**Day 47: Capstone Project**  
Finish grid search after plotting minimal percentage imporvement with each n_component unit increase.
Begin working on joining W matrix with big DF. How can I keep the results valid?

**Day 48: Capstone Project**
