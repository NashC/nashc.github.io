My name is Nash Collins. I currently live in San Francisco where I work as a Data Scientist, Management Consultant and Options Trader. I grew up in [Santa Cruz] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Cruz,_California) and received my undergraduate degree from [UC San Diego] (https://ucsd.edu/). I've also lived in Los Angeles and New York City for extended periods.

#####Some of my interests include:

* Sports: I play basketball regulary and love the Golden State Warriors
* Investing: I trade options and futures for my own account. I highly recommend [tastytrade] (http://www.tastytrade.com) for anyone interested in learning about options trading.
* Data Science: In Fall 2015 I attended the [Galvanzie Data Science Immersive Program] (http://www.galvanize.com/courses/data-science/) in San Francisco.
* Music: I play the piano and compose music using [Logic] (http://www.apple.com/logic-pro/) and [Reason] (https://www.propellerheads.se/reason).
* Reading: Mostly non-fiction. My favorite topics are: History, Economics, Psychology, Astronomy, Self-Improvement, Investing, Technology, Management and Entrepreneurship.

In this blog I will be writing about these and other interests in a variety of ways. I hope to meet other like-minded individuals and maybe even make some new friends.
