I’ve just finished the first week of the Galvanize Data Science Immersive Program. It was a dramatic introduction to a few of the fundamental tools in a Data Scientists toolbox. I’d say it was akin to being thrown into the deep end of the pool when you were five years old and told to start swimming. Difficulties aside, I learned a ton and had a lot of fun. I also enjoyed meeting all my  new classmates and learning about their diverse backgrounds. In this post I’ll outline the daily schedule of lectures and coding sprints, the topics taught each day and my general thoughts surrounding the first week of class.

###Typical Daily Schedule

* 900a:	Quiz
* 930a:	Morning Lecture
* 1030a:	Solo Code Sprint
* 1230p:	Lunch
* 130p: 	Afternoon Lecture
* 230p: 	Pair Programming Code Sprint
* 600-800p: End of Day some time in this range

We begin each day at 9:00a with a quiz. The quiz questions focus on what was taught the previous day and the readings in preparation for what will be taught later that day. At 930a, we get into the morning lecture. Here the instructor gives an introduction to the day’s material; usually showing us some of the steps required for the morning exercises. After the lecture, we dive into the morning coding sprint. The morning exercises are typically done alone. We each have 5-10 problems to complete before lunch. In week one, these were mostly on Python, SQL and Pandas. If you finish in time, you can go grab some lunch or you might have to leave the problems unfinished just to get some food.

We return from lunch to the afternoon lecture. The teacher might review some the problems from the morning set, and then do a deeper dive on the day’s topic in preparation for the afternoon sprint. The afternoon problems are done in teams of two people. This is called Pair Programming. Here both students are working on the same computer. The Driver is typing in the code, and the Navigator is helping talk through the solution or maybe looking up some info on Google or Stack Overflow. The afternoon problem set takes three to five hours to complete depending on how familiar your team is with the material. This means we’re leaving between 6:00-8:00p. Some students leave when they’re done with the sprint and others stay later to study more.


##Review of Days 1-5

**Day 1: Intro Presentation, Meet Your Classmates, Precourse Assessment and Python**  
The morning began with a breakfast presentation going over the logistics of the class. We played the name game and each had to tell the class our name, hometown and what kind of work we did prior to coming to Galvanize. We then jumped into a two hour test reviewing all of the pre-course study material (Python, SQL, Numpy, Scipy, Pandas, Probability, Statistics). I’m still learning Python and got stuck a few times googling around for help. I ended up spending too much time on these and wasn’t able to finish the whole assessment. Lunch was provided on the first day so we were able to have more conversations with our classmates. The afternoon lecture focused on GitHub and Python. All course materials are downloaded from and solutions are uploaded to GitHub. Git is a primary tool in the software industry and the school emphasizes its importance by making it an integral part of each day’s activities. The Python section focused on the use and efficiency of Python’s dictionary objects. Dictionaries allow storage of Key/Value pairs and are usually more computer efficient for storing information than list objects. Finishing off the day was a Python exercise focused on reading info from a text file and counting the number of characters or words in it.

**Day 2: Python Classes and Blackjack**  
Day 2 was more Python. The morning lecture covered the use of Python classes when building a program. The morning sprint had us adding functionality and editing the code of a program for playing the card game War. In the afternoon we had a very helpful lecture which taught us how to brainstorm and plan before starting to write a new program. We practiced outlining the Classes, Variables and Methods we might need before starting, then we can get right into writing the code from our outline. The day ended with a pair programming exercise of building a program to play blackjack between a human player and a dealer. We gave the dealer the house rules of staying on 17 or higher; it also allowed the human player to bet and kept track of their total winnings.

**Day 3: SQL**  
Data scientists have to lookup data in a variety of different databases. The SQL language has been around for a long time, but is still used at a lot of companies. We reviewed basic SELECT and WHERE statements. But we spent the most time working on JOIN statements and problems that utilized it. Unfortunately, I used half the morning sprint trying to install PostgreSQL and then couldn’t finish the exercise. Luckily, my partner in the afternoon was pretty strong and we were able to be one of the first groups finished.

**Day 4: SQL and Pandas**  
Thursday was on Pandas. This is a Python library allowing you to have all the database lookup functionality of SQL, but in a Python environment. Pandas allows you to input SQL syntax into Python or use it’s own methods to lookup info from a data set. The morning exercise was on using the SQL abilities and the afternoon was on using the native Pandas methods.

**Day 5: Moneyball, Pandas and Happy Hour**  
The final day of week one had more Pandas exercises. The instructors said Pandas becomes and essential part of your data science workflow and is heavily used for EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis). We used Pandas to work on a baseball statistics dataset. We had to find effective players for the lowest amount of money. It’s similar to the work done by Billy Beane, the General Manager of the Oakland A’s since 1989. It was also the focus of the movie Moneyball (link here) staring Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill. Billy was the first MLB executive to heavily rely on player statistics and analytics to draft and assemble talent. This was a lot of fun for me as I’m a huge sports fan. The day ended with a happy hour for the students not the rooftop. It was nice to relax and get a chance to discuss non-school topics with my peers.

**Weekly Summary**  
I started the week a little nervous as I didn’t know what to expect and wasn’t 100% sure how I’d react under the bootcamp environment. But following the end of the week I’m very optimistic for the rest of the program. I know I can keep up with the pace and am excited about what I’m going to learn in the weeks to come. Many of my classmates have Ph.D’s in topics like Physics or Bioinformatics, so I know I’ll be pushed academically. If I can hang with them, I think I’ll do alright.
